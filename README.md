# Handwritten-Digit-Classification
This project is focused on building a **Handwritten Digit Classification** model using machine learning techniques. The model classifies digits from 0 to 9 using image data and demonstrates the power of computer vision and deep learning.

## 📁 Dataset

We are using the **MNIST dataset**, which contains 70,000 grayscale images of handwritten digits (28x28 pixels).

## 🧪 Technologies Used

- Python 🐍
- Jupyter Notebook 📓
- Scikit-learn
- TensorFlow / Keras
- Matplotlib
- NumPy
- Pandas

## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow the steps below to get this project up and running on your local machine.

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/handwritten-digit-classification.git
cd handwritten-digit-classification
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

It’s recommended to use a virtual environment.

If you have a `requirements.txt` file, run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If `requirements.txt` is not available, install the required packages manually:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn tensorflow
```

### 3. Run the Notebook

Launch Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

Then open `Handwritten Digit Classification.ipynb` and run the cells step-by-step.

## 📊 Output Example

After training, the model will output:

- ✅ Accuracy metrics
- 📉 Confusion matrix
- 🔢 Digit classification predictions
- 📊 Visualizations of test results
